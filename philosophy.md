Advances in technology and science don't only occur through new developments, but through spreading understanding of those developments as widely as possible. The Gaussian process summer schools are a series of meetings designed to facilitate advances in and propagate understanding of the capabilities of Gaussian process models. We have also extended this philosophy to data science techniques in general with a particular focus on the developing world. These ideas are at the core of the [open data science agenda](http://opendsi.cc).

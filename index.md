The Gaussian Process Summer Schools are a series of schools and workshops aimed at researchers who want to understand and use Gaussian process models, both in theory and practice. The main summer schools are held in Sheffield, UK. But we also have a series of events that take the summer school 'on tour' with Gaussian Process Road 
Shows. 

### Upcoming Schools

[GPSS 2021](http://gpss.cc/gpss21/) will be a virtual event from September 13 to September 16, 2021. [Registrations](http://gpss.cc/gpss21/registration) are now open.  

### History of the Summer School

The first meetings were the [Gaussian Process Round Table](http://gpss.cc/gprt/) and [Gaussian Processes in Practice](http://gpss.cc/gpip/) meetings (in 2005/06). The formal, annual summer schools were started in June 2013 with the first [Gaussian Process Summer School](./gpss13). We also ran the first roadshow meeting, in [Kampala, Uganda](./gprs13/) in August 2013. Other road shows were at the [Gaussian Process Winter School in Genoa, Italy](./gprs15a) and the [Gaussian Process Summer School in Melbourne](./gprs15b), while Neil presented Gaussian processes at the [2015 Sydney Machine Learning Summer School](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/mlss/index.ipynb).
